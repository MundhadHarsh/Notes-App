NOTE MAKING APP:
PROBLEM STATEMENT: There are world efforts to make technology act with education field for better learning achievements. Technology tries to replace the traditional 
learning environments, media, and activities into digital age. However, slow progress has been achieved to transfer the note taking activities into digital era. In this study, we explored current note taking tools which developed to bridge the gap between paper ¬based and technology ¬based notes. We tried to identify key specific problems and challenges that prevent note taking from existing in the digital age. This study is providing extensive investigation with systematic analysis about the impacts of current note taking tools in learning to identify constrains and limitations of typical note taking systems. Unfortunately, we agreed with similar previous studies that current tools are still inadequate and inefficient to be used for replacing the traditional note taking due to several issues. We found that developing a successful note taking applications is challenges because of four main issues, complexity, technology learning dilemma, integrity, and inefficiency issues. This study discusses the main implications to shape the future of digital notes. Technology plays a vital role in day-to-day life activities which in turn made great changes in many work fields and out of them Mobile Application is one of the major developments. Mobile Application can be used effectively for this job as they are widely used and are known for easy access.
PROPOSED SOLUTION : Benefits of Digital Note Taking
Digital note-taking is always a topic I get lots of questions about. For students and/or workers who are accustomed to the pen and paper life, going digital 
with note-taking can seem a bit foreign, but I wanted to take some time today to highlight some of the benefits to embracing the world of typed notes and 
electronic handwriting!
1} Digital Notes Are SUPER Accessible.
2} Your Notes Can Be More Interactive: One of the many bonuses to digital note-taking is having the freedom to incorporate videos, podcasts, images, URL links, and more.
4} Editing Freedom. 
5} Searchable Notes.
6} Space Savers: As I write this blog post I am looking at a shelf in my office filled with old notebooks and textbooks….I have another stack back at my parents’ place.
As great as it sometimes is to sit down and flip through old notes, I can’t deny that it definitely eats up space when you keep everything.
Each year I am slowly eliminating my stack because I don’t see myself really needing any of my notes in the future (so many business concepts are easily google-able these days),
but I wouldn’t have to even go through that process if I had embraced more digital note-taking in my earlier years at university. Maybe this isn’t a dealbreaker for some, 
but it’s a point worth considering if you are limited in space in your home.



FUNCTIONALITY & CONCEPTS USED : Android provides us a feature with which we can store users’ data inside their mobile itself with different storage options 
such as Shared Preferences, SQLite database, and the Room Database. All the data storing techniques are having different use cases. In this article, we will
specifically take a look at using a Room Database with Architecture Components in Android. In this article, we will be specifically looking at components such 
as LiveData, ViewModel, and Room. We can get to see the explanation of each component in detail. Below is the guide for it. 

 
The components which we will be using inside the application are listed below with a detailed explanation : 
	LiveData: Live Data is a data holder class that can be observed. It holds as well as caches the latest version of the data and notifies our observer whenever 
the data is being updated or changed. Live Data automatically manages all of this since it is aware of the relevant lifecycle status changes while observing.

	ViewModel: View Modal acts as a communication center between repository and UI. The UI no longer needs to worry about the origin of the data. 
The ViewModel instances survive Activity/Fragment recreation.

	Repository: Repository is a class that is mainly used to manage multiple sources of data.

	Entity: Entity is an annotated class that is used to describe a database table when we are working with Room.

	Room Database: Room Database is an improvised version of SQLite Database. It simplifies the database work and serves as an access point to the underlying SQLite database. 
The room uses DAO to issue queries to the SQLite database.

	DAO: DAO is a Data Access Object which is used for mapping SQL queries to functions.

Future Scope :
FUTURE SCOPE: I am quite confident that within the next decade that note taking applications will evolve. The last major breakthrough for notes was being able to 
seamlessly share notes on multiple platforms via the cloud. With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence and machine learning, it is only with a matter of time 
that our tools become developed to suit our needs. Notes are meant to be shared and help us learn. When complicated things such as equations, diagrams, and formulas 
begin to inhibit how we take notes — less notes are bound to be shared. With the development of this new note taking tool, it will be easier for users to put their 
thoughts onto an easily accessible file to be shared to the world.
It may include Features as follows:
o	Cloud Storage
o	Multimedia Notes (audio, diagrams, web clippers, code snippets, etc.)
o	Cross Platform Support
